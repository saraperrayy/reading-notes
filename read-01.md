1. What is a component?

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.

2. What are the charactistics of a component?

* **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

* **Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* **Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

3. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

* Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

* Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.
