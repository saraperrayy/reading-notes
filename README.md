# Sara Elizabeth Perry

## Bio

I've always been a storyteller. Remember that kid in trouble for talking? That was me. I’m a firm believer that your childhood plays a major role in your future. Good or bad — the impression is up to you. Not one to be held back by my faults, in 2020 I leveraged my gift of communication and opened my business, Gemini Design Studio, LLC. My passion for individuality far exceeds the threads of a coveted jean jacket and is a value embedded in the foundation of Gemini Design Studio. Your brand is better when it is **YOU**. Much more than a pretty logo, your brand is crafted from your business’s core — *your values, your stories, your personality*.
