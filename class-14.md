# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Notes from [Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

The `transform` property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

### 2D Transforms

2D transforms work on the `x` and `y` axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes

* `rotate` value: rotates an element from 0 to 360 degrees
* `scale` value: allows you to change the size of an element
* `translate` value: pushing and pulling of an element in different directions
* `translateX` value: changes position on the horizontal axis
* `translateY` value: changes position on the vertical axis
* `skew` value: distorts elements
* `skewX` value: distorts element on the horizontal axis
* `skewY` value: distorts element on the vertical axis

### 3D Transforms

3D transforms work on the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes

## Notes from [Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

### Transitions

For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. There are 4 transition related properties 
1. `transition-property`: determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties
2. `transition-duration`: set using general timing values like seconds and milliseconds
3. `transition-timing-function`: used to set the speed in which a transition will move
4. `transition-delay`:  sets a time value that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing
