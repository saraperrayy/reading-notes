 # Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## HTML Structure

* HTML pages are text documents
* HTML uses tags
* Tags are often referred to as elements
* Tags usually come in pairs
* Opening tags denote the start of a oiece of content and the closing tag denotes the end
* Opening tags can carry attributes
* Attributes require a name and a value

## Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using
* You can add comments to your code between `<!-- and -->` markers
* id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements
* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together
* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages

## HTML5 Layout

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help describe its structure
* The new elements provide clearer code
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elememts
* Extra JavaScript is needed to make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8

## Process & Design

* It is important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what they are looking to find and when they will return
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
* Wireframes allow you to organize the page understand what you are trying to tell them
* You can differentiate between pieces of info using size, color and style
* Visual hierachy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the info you present

## What is a script and how do I create one?

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal
* Each time the script is run, it may only use a subset of the instructions
* Your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically
* Break down your goal into a series of tasks then work out each step needed to complete that task

## How a Browser Sees a Web Page

1. Receive a page as HTML code
2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory
3. Use a rendering engine to shower the page on screen

## How do computers fit in with the world around them?

* Computers create models of the world using data
* Models use objects to represent physical things
* Objects can have properties, methods and events
* **Properties** tell us about the object
* **Methods** perform tasks using the properties of the object
* **Events** are triggered when a user interacts with the computer
* Each element in HTML creates its own node (which is a kind of object)

## How HTML, CSS and JavaScript Fit Together

How do I write a script for a web page?

* JavaScript files are text files that have the .js extension
* HTML `<script>` element tells the browser to load the JavaScript file
* HTML `<link>` elements can be used to load CSS
