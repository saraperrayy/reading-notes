# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

This section summarizes material covered in Duckett HTML & CSS 

### HTML Text

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page
* HTML elements provide semantic info (where emphasis should be placed, quotations)

### Introducing CSS

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicatie how the element should look
* Rules are made up selectors and declarations
* Selectors specify the elements the rule applies to
* Declarations indicate what these elements should look like
* Declarations are made up of two parts: properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document

## JavaScript

and Duckett JavaScript books

### Basic JavaScript Instructions

* A script is made up of a series of statements
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of info used in the script
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related info
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean Values (true or false)
* Expressions evaluate into a single value
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

### Decisions and Loops

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next
* comparison operators are used to compare two operands
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparision operators
* **if...else statements** allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and if another if it is false
* **switch statements** allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (or default option)
* data types can be coerced from one type to another
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy
* **break** causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside of the loop
* **continue** tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then check the condition again. If it's true, the code runs again
* **for loop** — the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run (if you need to run code a specific number of times)
* **while loop** — the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true (if you do not know how many times the code should run)
* **do while loop** always runs the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false
