# Growth Mindset

## What is a growth mindset?

With talent and intelligence put aside, a growth mindset is reflected in perseverance and effort. Rather than accepting intelligence as a fixed trait, which suggests one may simply be born with it, a growth mindset is an optimistic belief that you can learn whatever you set your mind to. 
Simply stated, ***what the mind can conceive, it can achieve.***

## How to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Always have a positive outlook on the situation
2. Put forth the appropriate effort — No pain, no gain
3. Don't ignore criticism, but rather learn from it

### About Sara

I've always been a storyteller. Remember that kid in trouble for talking? That was me. I’m a firm believer that your childhood plays a major role in your future. Good or bad — the impression is up to you. Not one to be held back by my faults, in 2020 I leveraged my gift of communication and opened my business, Gemini Design Studio, LLC. My passion for individuality far exceeds the threads of a coveted jean jacket and is a value embedded in the foundation of Gemini Design Studio. Your brand is better when it is **YOU**. Much more than a pretty logo, your brand is crafted from your business’s core — *your values, your stories, your personality*.
