## The key characteristics of 'enhanced teams'

1. **Psychological safety**: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
2. **Dependability**: Everyone completes quality work on time.
3. **Structure and clarity**: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
4. **Meaning**: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.)
5. **Impact**: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.

## If you’re right brained:

1. **Develop a strategic mindset.** Know and understand what drives company to success.
2. **Be known for something.** Do you have deep expertise in relevant areas? (i.e., financial acumen, scientific expertise or even highly specialized knowledge such as tax law or M&A accounting). Be proactive in mastering them.
4. **Practice tackling complex problems.** This is especially helpful with those tricky interview questions that Google is famous for. Use those linear thinking skills to your advantage by diving deeply into issues.

## If you’re left brained:

1. **Develop learning agility.** Instead of defaulting to the “tried and true” (which pragmatists tend to do), be open to trying varied approaches and new ideas.
2. **Find joy in ambiguity.** Practice coping with uncertainty and making decisions without having all the information beforehand.
3. **Put your social leadership skills to the test.** When was the last time you motivated influenced others or deeply connected with your teammates? You might come to find that you actually enjoy it.
