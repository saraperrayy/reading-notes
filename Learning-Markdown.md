# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to format the style of text on the web using simple non-alphabetic characters.

## How to use Markdown

### Headers

To create a heading, you can start a line with `#`. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading. You can include up to 6 tiers of headings to style your text. 

`# this is an <h1> heading`

`## this is an <h2> heading`

### Paragraphs

You can create new paragraphs by leaving a blank line between each new section. 

### Text Styling

Bold `**` or `__ __`

Italic `*` or `_ _`

Strikethrough `~~`

Bold and Nested Italics `** **` and `_ _`

All bold and Italics `*** ***`

#### Emphasis



#### Quotes

To quote text, use a `>`

#### Quoting Code

Use backticks to create distinct blocks around code examples. To format code or text into distinct blocks, use triple backticks. This creates a visual snapshot of the example. 

### Lists

There are numerous ways to create lists using Markdown. 

#### Ordered

To created an ordered list, simply start the line with a number. 

#### Unordered

To create unordered lists, start the line with a `-` or a `*`

### Images

### Links

To create an inline link, wrap your text in brackets `[ ]` and wrap the url in parentheses `( )`
