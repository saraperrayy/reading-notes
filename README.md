# Growth Mindset

## What is a growth mindset?

With talent and intelligence put aside, a growth mindset is reflected in perseverance and effort. Rather than accepting intelligence as a fixed trait, which suggests one may simply be born with it, a growth mindset is an optimistic belief that you can learn whatever you set your mind to. 
***Simply stated, what the mind can conceive, it can achieve.***

## How to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Always have a positive outlook on the situation
2. Put forth the appropriate effort â€” No pain, no gain
3. Don't ignore criticism, but rather learn from it
