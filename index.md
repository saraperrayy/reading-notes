# Growth Mindset

## What is a growth mindset?

With talent and intelligence put aside, a growth mindset is reflected in perserverance and effort. Rather than accepting intelligence as a fixed trait, which suggests one may simply be born with it, a growth mindset is an optimistic belief that you can learn whatever you set your mind to. Simply stated, what the mind can conceive, it can achieve.
