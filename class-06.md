# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Object Literals (pp.100-105)

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on a new name.

In an object:

* variables become properties
* functions become methods
* a name becomes a key
* the value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array or even another project
* the value of a method is always a function
* you can access the properties or methods using dot notation or square brackets
